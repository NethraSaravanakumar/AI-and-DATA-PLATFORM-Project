The Data and AI Synergy Hub
Driving Migration and Transformation project aims to address key challenges in customer data analysis, predictive modeling, and data communication that hinder effective business decision-making. This AI-driven platform integrates data extraction, transformation, visualization, and interactive query handling to provide an end-to-end solution for enhanced data-driven decision-making. Initially leveraging SAP Analytics Cloud, the project evolved to ensure greater transparency in predictive modeling by utilizing the Prophet forecasting library for time-series predictions. The platform enables users to gain deeper insights through dynamic visualizations and employs Zephyr-7B Alpha, a large language model, to facilitate efficient and user-friendly chatbot interactions. By harnessing these tools alongside data transformation pipelines powered by PySpark and Langchain, this solution provides a streamlined, holistic approach to analyzing and communicating customer data, ultimately enabling organizations to make more informed, strategic decisions with confidence.
